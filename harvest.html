        Harvest III, 2018
      </div>

      <div class="footer-project-description">
        Could the human body ever be programmed to produce its own food source?
        <br><br>
        Harvest III delivers a sacrificial dining experience in the Temple of Heaven, Beijing to question the future of food production and technology. The Temple of Heaven is an ancient building where the emperor of the Ming Dynasty and Qing Dynasty held the ‘Heaven Worship Ceremony’ in prayer for good harvest.
        <br><br>
        Harvest III is a social commentary on the natural and artificial, producer and consumer, human and non-human. The proposal speculates the production of Genetically Modified Foods &mdash; the direct process of manipulating the DNA of an organism’s genes using bio technology.
        <br><br>
        Could the processing of an autotroph (consumer, human) and heterotroph (producer, plant) combine to produce biological hybrid?
        <br><br>
        This speculative hybrid, simultaneously nourishes and serves light, water and sustenance in the Temple Of heaven, Beijing to deliver ‘body-self harvest’ routine to humans.
        <br><br>
        Pipes extract the internal fluid from the entity to serve liquid to occupants to consume. Surrounding the circumference of the bar is a clothing frame where multiple luminescent suits hang that replicate the membrane of the entity. Occupants are to strip their clothing and put on the suit to dine. This ritual becomes a metaphor for sustainable harvesting methods &mdash; the undressing acts as pesticide removal and recycling to reduce the depletion of natural resources.
        <br><br>
        The wearable is activated through a series of ‘body self-harvesting’ spaces that utilise water, heat and light for the human body to produce food.
        <br><br>
        Occupants are directed to the elevator &mdash; a transitional and heterotopic space that creates an interconnection between death and rebirth. Surrounded by a pool of light and mist, occupants remain motionless as they feel their skin absorb and feed of water and light. Returning to the elevator, occupants transfer to the bathroom to urinate any remaining liquid from the source. The laboratory / control room is responsible for the biotechnology and operations behind the entire ‘body-self harvest’ processes.
        <br><br>
        Harvest III combines ancient and contemporary mythology to create a transformative and bodily dining experience. The biological hybrid serves a hypothetical method for nourishment, were humans transmigrate into a new form to produce their own food source &mdash; an immersive metaphor and prayer, for sustainable agricultural harvesting.
